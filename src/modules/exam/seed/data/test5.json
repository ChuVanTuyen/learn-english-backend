Construction was postponed for a time because of an unanticipated problem related to the ground conditions on the site. However, the problem has been resolved, and the 40,000-square-metre centre should be fully operational in June. The grand opening is planned for the fourth of June. The warehouse has a special area with state-of-the-art equipment to store foods that need to be kept frozen or cool. The site will also include loading bays and offices.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The distribution centre is expected to create more than 400 new jobs, according to Myles Simler, vice president of operations. Because of the size and scope of the project, a variety of jobs will be needed, from warehouse loaders and drivers to clerical positions.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/migiitoeic.eupgroup.net\/uploads\/image_ETS\/9e177d9de5395793dfedbb03d7f00282.png\" style=\"width:100%\" \/><\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/migiitoeic.eupgroup.net\/uploads\/image_ETS\/91d57448d28bf5380884dfdf945b21eb.png\" style=\"width:100%\" \/><\/p>",
