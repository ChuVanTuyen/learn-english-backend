Scott Moore, 66, was presented the award during yesterday&#39;s annual ACSB meeting in Norwalk.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">According to an ACSB press release, the award is given every year to &quot;an individual who has contributed significantly to the betterment of the steel industry.&quot; ACSB spokesperson Cora Schroeder said, &quot;Mr. Moore devotes his spare time to ensuring quality in our industry. For the past decade, he has&nbsp;dedicated himself to helping the ACSB monitor and refine steel-production standards and practices. This year, he chaired a committee that created an improved set of standards for structural steel used in the construction of bridges.&quot;<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Mr. Moore was born and raised in Bingham and received his engineering degree from Bingham University. After graduating, he worked as a construction manager during the building of Bingham&#39;s new city hall. He joined Marshall Steel 39 years ago as a building supervisor, ultimately rising to his current position of senior project engineer.<\/p>",

The new hotel was at full capacity nearly every weekend during the summer. Weekday occupancy also exceeded expectations.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The hotel&#39;s manager, Anika Bastien, said, &quot;Tourists were thrilled with the array of&nbsp;amenities offered, including 24-hour dining options, a free shuttle to nearby beaches, and free Wi-Fi. In fact, many have already reserved rooms for next summer.- [2] -.&quot;<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Sustern has become the most popular&nbsp;tourist destination in the region, with about 20 percent more beachgoers than the Delmire shore, its biggest competitor.- [3] -. Experts attribute this to the growing number of outlet stores in Sustern, overall lower prices, and an abundance of new restaurants, hotels, and community events. Tourists continue to visit the area after the prime beach months, keeping hotel rooms occupied longer. - [4] -.<\/p>",

According to Charles Gruber, town clerk, the renovation of the Eldonbury Community Centre came in well under budget. The council, therefore, decided to compile a list of smaller improvement projects that could be done with the leftover funds.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Some suggested projects include adding a covered entryway to the Eldonbury Public Library, improving lighting in Westfall Park, and replacing floors in the Town Hall. According to Mr. Gruber, the council will solicit ideas from members of the public. Interested parties may voice their opinions at the council&#39;s meeting on Tuesday, 20 March, at 4:00 P.M. or send an e-mail to the council office before 31 March. After the period of public comment, the planning committee will put forth a final list for the council to discuss, with a decision expected by 15 April.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/migiitoeic.eupgroup.net\/uploads\/image_ETS\/0d55ddca518f6f2abfeffb1d2cb058d7.png\" style=\"width:100%\" \/><\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/migiitoeic.eupgroup.net\/uploads\/image_ETS\/d78a811670b4ef43c49f1ced2b4c0139.png\" style=\"width:100%\" \/><\/p>",
