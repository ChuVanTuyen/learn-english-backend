These brakes are made from a\u00a0special lightweight material that cools down more\u00a0quickly after use, which means these brakes will last much longer than ordinary brakes. Kendris, which was founded just three years ago, will\u00a0demonstrate their new brakes at the Annual\u00a0Innovation Trade Show in August before offering\u00a0them for sale the following month.

The first Shiner Crisp is expected to become available to consumers as early as next year. -[2]- .<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Apple breeders design new apples especially to better compete with such traditional apple varieties as Reds and Juiceys. The development process involves a&nbsp;considerable investment of time and money in repeated taste tests for their new fruits. -[3]- . Whereas Reds and Juiceys average $1.29 per pound, new types of apples (such as the hugely popular Branburs and Honey-Sweets) are raking in at least three times as much.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">These additions have major long-term impacts on the market, too. Two decades ago, Reds and Juiceys comprised over 50<br \/>percent of all apple sales; now their sales are less than 25 percent of the market. It is no wonder that apple breeders are racing to come up with the next popular apple! -[4]-.<\/p>",

For twenty years, Dr. Matambo has been the director of the Hawthorne Clinic, located near Hawthorne City University. Among the nearly 180 well-wishers in attendance were also some former patients who attested to the honoree&#39;s kindness and professionalism.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Dr. Matambo has also been a familiar face at local charity events, and in particular, he has helped to raise money for many area schools. His immediate plans are to take a month-long vacation on a cruise ship with his wife, Alicia Matambo.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Although Dr. Matambo is retiring, he will remain involved with the clinic as a consultant. A new director has been approved by the Hawthorne Clinic&#39;s board of trustees and is expected to be announced later this week.<\/p>",

The international pop superstar announced that she has added a free concert in Lafont to her Long Road tour, which begins on June 2. Benitez will perform in Lafont on July 17.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Born in nearby Ollender, Benitez moved to Lafont with her family when she was five years old. She graduated from Jasper High School, where she first caught the attention of peers and teachers by winning the school-wide talent show at the age of fourteen, the first time she ever set foot on a stage. Since then, she has embarked on a professional career that has taken her to five continents and has won her millions of fans all over the world.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">Benitez made the decision to add a concert in Lafont when her manager, Jeremy Hampton, brought to her attention a three-day break after a show in Chicago. &quot;It was obvious to both of us,&quot; Benitez said in a&nbsp;phone call from her recording studio in Los Angeles. &quot;To be so close to Lafont with an extra three days and not do a show would be unthinkable. It was a very easy decision to make.&quot;<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The only challenge was finding a venue that would accommodate all of Benitez&#39; hometown fans. The town&#39;s largest theater seats only 1,200. Lafont Mayor Ellis Swanson came up with a creative solution. &quot;He suggested an outdoor concert,&quot; said Benitez. &quot;Not at a stadium, but at a local farm outside of town. That way there won&#39;t be a limit on how many people can attend. We&#39;ll just set up a stage in the middle of a huge field.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">&quot;Local radio DJ Taylor Wendel estimates that as many as 8,000 fans might turn out for the concert.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">&quot;Considering how popular Sonia is around here, and considering the concert is free, I think that&#39;s a conservative estimate,&quot; says Wendel. &quot;It&#39;s going to be a memorable event.&quot;<\/p><p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Benitez Plays to Big Crowd<\/strong><\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">LAFONT (July 18)-Sonia Benitez&#39; homecoming concert last night in a field at Gingham Hills Farm was nothing short of phenomenal. The crowd of 10,000-plus was delighted to welcome the hometown hero, who was making her first trip back to Lafont in more than 12 years. Benitez put on quite a show, extending her usual two-hour set of songs by another hour with an additional eight songs.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\">The evening&#39;s most memorable moment (of which there were many) came when Benitez was joined onstage by pianist Genevieve Parker, another native of Lafont and friend of Sonia&#39;s since the age of six. While perhaps not as well known as Benitez, Parker is an equally accomplished musician, having studied classical piano in Vienna and having toured internationally with the Vienna Touring Orchestra.<\/p><p style=\"text-align:justify\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/migiitoeic.eupgroup.net\/uploads\/image_ETS\/1b3106985e0475fd6fbe26f134ef02c3.png\" style=\"width:100%\" \/><\/p>",
