First, the site is not as ---1--- as it should be. We recommend updating its appearance and adding information that meets the demands of today&rsquo;s tourists. Note also that your organization&rsquo;s logo is not used consistently ---2--- your Web site. You should also consider supplementing the imagery used to promote the city. ---3---. We therefore recommend uploading some professionally made videos featuring the various attractions Brookside has to offer. ---4---, we suggest adding a page to the Web site that allows residents and visitors to upload their own photos and videos of city attractions. Please contact me at your earliest convenience to discuss the next steps.<\/p><p>Best regards,<br \/>Shelly Luu<br \/>Luu Marketing&nbsp;<\/p>",
